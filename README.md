# Thank you
Hello, thank you for the opportuntiy to do this and for your time.

I've split this project into 4 pieces

UI - Typescript and React

API - .Netcore 6 web API

Models - .Netcore 6 class lib

Services - .Netcore 6 class lib

UI is rather bare bones but is functional within the requirements.

Looking forward to speaking with you
Keegan
